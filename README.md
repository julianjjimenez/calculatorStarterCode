# calculatorStarterCode
1. This project completes functions with parameters x and y through the use of console commands to call on a functions
2. This project functions by defining functions utilizing parameters x and y. when the actual buttons on the calculator are pressed they set the parameters for x and y and calls the function to complete the function with theses parameters.
3. With more time, I would add more complicated functions like being able to take different logs other than log base 10. I would also incorperate a way to take the reciprocal of different numbers.
